# Base controller board

This is a barebones design for a microcontroller board based around the atmega32u4
microcontroller. This serves as a starting point for designs that support specific
digital ICs.

Designed in KiCad.

## Key features
- Powered via usb (5V)
- 3.3V used for IO
- external clock, enabling the chip to run at 16mhz
- supports serial communication over the usb connector.
